# JavaScript Basics

## Code
This contains various examples of JavaScript fundamentals. Different sections are broken up as separate files. A few examples are dependent on functions from other files (import/export).

### Setup:
I created this in Visual Studio Code, JavaScript-SDK 4.1.0 / 4.2.0

#### Description:
I made this program to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, it covers the following topics:

Assignment operators, basic variables and math, bracket notation, word blanks, arrays, shopping list, functions, global/local scope, "stand in line", boolean logic, if statments, "golf" code, switch statements, counting cards, objects, "record collecting", while/for/do-while loops, profile lookup, random numbers (whole and decimal), var vs. let, const, immutable object / mutating object, arrow functions, rest / spread operator, destructuring objects, template literals, classes, getters/setters, import/export

## first_program:
This folder holds almost every program file for this tutorial. Almost all files are independent with a few being dependent on specific files (import/export example for instance). Most run on their own and output various demonstrations.
